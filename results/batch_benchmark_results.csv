The Excel report contains three main tabs. First, Repository Review. This provides a high-level overview of the codebase across dimensions like code style and consistency, the DRY principle modularity and the security compliance. Second is Files Review. This tab is especially useful when multiple files are uploaded. The system separates the review files wise, making it easy to navigate through different components of the codebase. Line Level Review. This is the most detailed view, breaking down the review of every single line in the uploaded code. Here you can see the issue category, the start and end line numbers, the original code snippet, a summary of the issue, the refactor, the extracted version of the code, and the severity level along with the score. For example, you will notice that here in this example, the line chain imports are present but aren't being used anywhere in the file. So that is being addressed. Also on the line 75 here you can see there is a function defined without any doc strings which affects readability and documentation quality. That is being addressed as well.","Now let's take a look at the comprehensive code review report generated by our Agent X system. The Excel report contains three main tabs. First, Repository Review.
